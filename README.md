## Memory Management Simulator in C++
A Memory Management Simulator in C++ is a program that emulates how memory is allocated, used, and deallocated in a system. It helps in understanding memory management techniques such as stack allocation, heap allocation, paging, segmentation, and garbage collection.

## How It Works
A memory management simulator typically consists of the following components:

# 1. Memory Representation
The program represents memory as an array or vector, where each index corresponds to a memory address.
Each block of memory has a status (allocated, free, or reserved).
It keeps track of processes using memory (linked lists, maps, or tables).
# 2. Allocation Strategies
The simulator implements different memory allocation strategies, such as:

First Fit → Allocates the first free block that fits the request.
Best Fit → Finds the smallest free block that fits the request.
Worst Fit → Allocates the largest free block available.
Paging → Simulates page-based memory management.
Segmentation → Simulates segment-based memory allocation.
# 3. Deallocation
Memory can be freed manually (delete in C++) or automatically (garbage collection simulation).
The simulator may implement compaction to remove fragmentation.
# 4. Performance Analysis
The simulator tracks memory usage, fragmentation, and allocation failures.
It can generate statistics such as average memory utilization and fragmentation percentage.
